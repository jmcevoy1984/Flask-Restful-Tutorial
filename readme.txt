This is based on a Flask-Restful tutorial by Miguel Grinberg for creating a JSON API.

The tutorial can be found here: http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/designing-a-restful-api-using-flask-restful

I have modified it slightly to use a real database with models created with Flask-SQLAlchemy.
I use Flask-ALembic and Flask-Migrate to handle migrations.
The database uses SQLite

I have not included the Flask-HTTPAuth module for now.

All code is Python 3.4
